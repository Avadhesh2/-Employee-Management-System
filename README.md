## Introduction

The Employee Management System is designed to streamline the process of managing employee data within an organization. It provides a user-friendly interface for administrators to perform tasks such as viewing all employees, adding new employees, removing employees, and filtering employees based on various criteria. The system is built using Django, which offers a robust foundation for developing web applications quickly and efficiently.

## Modules

The Employee Management System consists of the following four modules:

1. **View All Employees**: This module allows administrators to view a list of all employees currently registered in the system. It provides essential details about each employee, facilitating quick reference and overview.

2. **Add Employee**: The "Add Employee" module enables administrators to input and store new employee information. This includes details such as name, department, contact information, and other relevant data.

3. **Remove Employee**: The "Remove Employee" module permits administrators to remove employees from the system when necessary. This can help keep the employee records up-to-date and accurate.

4. **Filter Employee**: The "Filter Employee" module empowers administrators to search and filter employees based on specific criteria. This functionality aids in finding employees who meet particular requirements or characteristics.
